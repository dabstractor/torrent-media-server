Product Requirements Document: Automated Media Library Organization
Document Status:	Draft
Feature Name:	"Zero-Touch" Media Ingestion for Plex
Author:	Gemini AI
Version:	1.0
Date:	September 15, 2025
1. Introduction & Problem Statement

Problem: Users of Plex Media Server who acquire media through tools like qBittorrent face a tedious, manual, and error-prone process to organize their library. After a download completes, the user must:

Navigate to the download directory.

Identify the downloaded files.

Rename the files and folders to a Plex-compliant format (e.g., Movie Title (Year)).

Move the renamed files to the correct media directory (/movies or /tv).

Trigger a library scan in Plex.

This manual workflow is inefficient, results in inconsistent naming, and delays the availability of new media for viewing.

Vision: To create a fully automated, "fire-and-forget" system where a user can request a movie or TV show, and it will appear in their Plex library, correctly named, organized, and ready to watch, with zero manual intervention after the initial request.

2. Goals & Objectives

Primary Goal: Fully automate the post-download processing of media files for seamless integration into a Plex library.

Secondary Goals:

Ensure 100% of media download traffic is routed through a secure VPN connection.

Standardize all media file and folder naming conventions for optimal metadata matching in Plex.

Eliminate the need for manual file management, reducing user effort and potential for error.

Minimize the time between download completion and media availability in Plex.

3. User Persona

Name: Alex, the "Home Server Enthusiast"

Bio: Alex is technically proficient and runs a home server for media and other personal projects. They are comfortable with Docker and the command line but value automation that saves time on day-to-day tasks. Their goal is to build a robust, low-maintenance system that "just works" for their family's media consumption needs.

4. User Stories

As Alex, I want to add a movie to a watchlist, so that the system automatically finds the best available version and downloads it without my intervention.

As Alex, I want completed downloads to be automatically identified and processed, so that I don't have to monitor the download client.

As Alex, I want downloaded files to be correctly renamed and moved from the temporary download folder to the permanent media library folder, so that my library stays organized and clean.

As Alex, I want Plex to automatically detect and add the new media to its library, so that it is immediately available for streaming on any device.

As Alex, I want all download activity to be private and secure, so that my internet privacy is maintained.

5. Functional Requirements
ID	Requirement	Description
FR-1	Centralized Indexer Management	The system (Prowlarr) must provide a single point of configuration for all Usenet and Torrent indexers, syncing them automatically to content management tools (Sonarr, Radarr).
FR-2	Content Discovery & Queuing	The system (Sonarr, Radarr) must be able to monitor for requested media, search configured indexers, and send the selected download to the download client (qBittorrent).
FR-3	Secure & Isolated Downloading	All traffic from the download client (qBittorrent) must be routed exclusively through a VPN container to ensure privacy and security. The download client should not be directly accessible from the host network.
FR-4	Completed Download Detection	The content managers (Sonarr, Radarr) must actively monitor the download client for downloads that have reached 100% completion.
FR-5	File Path Translation	The system must correctly translate file paths between the download client container and the content manager containers. It must recognize that a file at /downloads/ in the qbittorrent context is accessible at /downloads/ in the sonarr/radarr context. This will be achieved via Remote Path Mappings.
FR-6	Media Renaming & Organization	Upon completed download detection, the system shall: 1. Copy or hardlink the media file. 2. Rename the file and its parent folder to a user-defined, Plex-friendly format. 3. Move the renamed content to the final destination folder (/movies for Radarr, /tv for Sonarr).
FR-7	Post-Import Cleanup	The system should offer an option to automatically delete the original files from the download directory after a successful import to prevent storage duplication.
FR-8	Automatic Library Update	The Plex Media Server must automatically detect new files added to the media directories and trigger a library scan to fetch metadata and make the content available.
6. Non-Functional Requirements
ID	Requirement	Description
NFR-1	Reliability	All services must be configured to restart automatically on failure (restart: unless-stopped). The system should gracefully handle container restarts and maintain its state.
NFR-2	Performance	The time from download completion to Plex availability should be less than 5 minutes for a standard-sized file. The file import process (copy/move) should not significantly impact host system performance.
NFR-3	Security	The network architecture must isolate the download client within the VPN network, preventing any potential leaks. User-facing UIs should be accessible via a reverse proxy for consolidated access.
NFR-4	Configurability	The entire stack should be configurable via environment variables (.env) and configuration files, allowing for easy deployment and customization without modifying the core docker-compose.yml.
7. System Architecture & Dependencies

The feature is an integrated system of containerized services orchestrated by Docker Compose. The core components are:

Management Layer: Prowlarr, Sonarr, Radarr

Execution Layer: qBittorrent (via VPN)

Presentation Layer: Plex Media Server

Security Layer: VPN container

Networking: A media_network for inter-service communication and a vpn_network for isolating the download client.

8. Assumptions

The user has a working Docker and Docker Compose environment.

The user has provided a valid .env file with all necessary configurations (ports, paths, tokens).

The host machine has sufficient storage in the designated downloads and media directories.

The user has access to and has configured valid indexers within Prowlarr.

9. Success Metrics (KPIs)

Automation Rate: >99% of all completed downloads are successfully processed and imported without any manual user intervention.

Time-to-Plex: The average time from a download being marked "complete" in qBittorrent to the media being fully scanned and available in Plex. Target: < 5 minutes.

Import Error Rate: The percentage of downloads that fail to import automatically and require manual intervention. Target: < 1%.

10. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for v1.0)

Notifications: Integration with a notification service (e.g., Notifiarr) to alert the user when media has been downloaded and added to Plex.

Subtitle Management: Automated fetching of subtitles for all media using a service like Bazarr.

Expanded Media Types: Adding support for Music (Lidarr) and Books (Readarr) into the same automated workflow.
