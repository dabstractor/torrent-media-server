## Additional Errors Found by Code Analysis

8. **Missing Dependency in package.json**
   - Error: `date-fns` module is imported but not listed in package.json
   - Location: `src/components/settings/backups/BackupList.tsx`
   - Description: Missing dependency that causes module not found errors

9. **Hardcoded Service Names**
   - Error: Services like "qbittorrent" are hardcoded without configuration options
   - Location: Multiple API routes
   - Description: Application assumes services are available at specific hostnames

10. **No Error Handling for Service Failures**
    - Error: Repeated authentication failures without proper user feedback
    - Location: `/api/downloads/stream/route.ts`
    - Description: Application keeps retrying failed connections without informing user

11. **Missing API Route Error Handling**
    - Error: API routes don't properly handle connection failures
    - Location: Multiple `/api/` routes
    - Description: Errors propagate without proper HTTP status codes or messages

12. **No Fallback for Missing Services**
    - Error: Application completely fails when dependent services are unavailable
    - Location: Various components that depend on external services
    - Description: No graceful degradation when services like qBittorrent are down

13. **Incorrect Role Selectors in Tests**
    - Error: Tests fail to find elements by role
    - Location: Header and mobile navigation tests
    - Description: UI elements may not have proper accessibility attributes

14. **Missing Loading States**
    - Error: UI shows blank or error states instead of loading indicators
    - Location: Settings page and other data-dependent components
    - Description: Poor user experience when data is loading

15. **No Retry Logic for Failed Connections**
    - Error: Single attempt connections with no retry mechanism
    - Location: Service integration code
    - Description: Transient network issues cause permanent failures

16. **Missing Input Validation**
    - Error: No validation for service configuration inputs
    - Location: Settings page forms
    - Description: Invalid URLs or credentials can cause application errors

17. **No Connection Testing Before Use**
    - Error: Application tries to use services without testing connectivity first
    - Location: Service initialization code
    - Description: Users only discover connection issues when services are actually used

18. **Missing Error Boundaries**
    - Error: Component errors can crash entire pages
    - Location: React component tree
    - Description: No protection against component-level failures

19. **Inconsistent Error Messaging**
    - Error: Different error formats across the application
    - Location: Various API endpoints and UI components
    - Description: Makes error handling and debugging more difficult

20. **No Offline Support**
    - Error: Application completely fails when network is unavailable
    - Location: All pages that depend on API calls
    - Description: No caching or offline functionality

## Summary

The application has numerous critical issues that need to be addressed:

1. Missing dependencies (date-fns)
2. Service connection failures (qBittorrent)
3. UI accessibility issues (mobile navigation)
4. Configuration problems (environment variables)
5. Poor error handling and user feedback
6. Missing dependency management
7. No graceful degradation for service failures

These errors were identified by running Playwright tests and analyzing the codebase directly.
