# PRP 019: Dynamic Service URLs - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of dynamic service URLs for the Services Dashboard UI, which replaces hard-coded `localhost` URLs with dynamically generated URLs based on the browser's current hostname.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `web-ui/src/components/services/ServiceCard.tsx`

Key changes:
- Added a `generateDynamicUrl` function that:
  - Parses the original service URL using the `URL` constructor
  - Constructs a new URL using:
    - `window.location.protocol` for the protocol (http/https)
    - `window.location.hostname` for the hostname
    - The original port and pathname from the service URL
  - Includes error handling that falls back to the original URL if parsing fails
- Updated the link `href` attribute to use the dynamically generated URL
- Updated the metadata display to show `window.location.hostname` instead of the service URL's hostname
- Updated the link title to show the full dynamic URL

### 2. Updated `web-ui/src/__tests__/components/services/ServiceCard.test.tsx`

Key changes:
- Added mock for `window.location` to test dynamic URL generation
- Updated existing tests to expect dynamic URLs instead of hardcoded localhost URLs
- Fixed an existing test that was checking for incorrect CSS classes
- Added new tests to verify:
  - Dynamic URL generation with different hostnames
  - Fallback behavior when URL parsing fails
  - Dynamic URL generation with HTTPS protocol

## Implementation Details

### Dynamic URL Generation Logic
The new `generateDynamicUrl` function works as follows:
```javascript
const generateDynamicUrl = (originalUrl: string): string => {
  try {
    const serviceUrl = new URL(originalUrl);
    // Use window.location.protocol for the protocol, window.location.hostname for the hostname,
    // and keep the original port and pathname
    return `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.hostname}:${serviceUrl.port}${serviceUrl.pathname}`;
  } catch (error) {
    // If URL parsing fails, fall back to the original URL
    console.warn('Failed to parse service URL, falling back to original:', originalUrl);
    return originalUrl;
  }
};
```

### Error Handling
- The implementation gracefully handles malformed URLs by falling back to the original URL
- Errors are logged to the console with a warning message
- All existing functionality is preserved even if URL generation fails

## Validation
- All ServiceCard component tests pass
- New tests cover dynamic URL generation scenarios
- Backward compatibility is maintained
- No changes were required to backend services or environment variable configurations

## Benefits
- Users can now access services from any machine on their network, not just the host machine
- The solution works with various deployment scenarios (localhost, IP addresses, domain names)
- Security constraints are maintained (particularly for qBittorrent's VPN isolation)
- All existing functionality continues to work correctly
