name: "Fix UI and Server-Side Errors"
description: |
  This PRP outlines the necessary steps to resolve a series of critical UI, server-side, and configuration errors identified during testing. The goal is to stabilize the application, improve user experience, and create a more robust error-handling framework.

---

## Goal

**Feature Goal**: Resolve all errors listed in `UI_ERRORS_FOUND.md` to create a stable and reliable user experience.

**Deliverable**: A fully functional and error-free UI, with robust server-side error handling, proper configuration management, and comprehensive test coverage to prevent regressions.

**Success Definition**: All Playwright tests pass, all UI errors are resolved, and the application gracefully handles service failures and invalid user input.

## Why

- **Business value and user impact**: A stable and reliable application is essential for user retention and satisfaction. Fixing these errors will improve the overall user experience and reduce user frustration.
- **Integration with existing features**: Proper error handling and configuration management are crucial for the long-term maintainability and scalability of the application.
- **Problems this solves and for whom**: This PRP addresses critical issues that affect all users of the application, from developers to end-users.

## All Needed Context

### Context Completeness Check

_Before writing this PRP, validate: "If someone knew nothing about this codebase, would they have everything needed to implement this successfully?"_

### Documentation & References

```yaml
- file: UI_ERRORS_FOUND.md
  why: This file contains a comprehensive list of all the errors that need to be addressed.
  pattern: The implementing agent should use this file as a checklist to ensure all errors are resolved.

- file: package.json
  why: This file provides a list of all project dependencies, which is essential for understanding the project's technology stack.
  pattern: The implementing agent should use this file to identify any missing dependencies and to understand the project's existing libraries.

- file: PRPs/templates/prp_base.md
  why: This file provides the template for creating PRPs, which is essential for ensuring consistency and completeness.
  pattern: The implementing agent should use this file as a guide for structuring the implementation plan.
```

### Desired Codebase tree with files to be added and responsibility of file

```bash
src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx # A new component to gracefully handle UI errors.
src/components/common/ToastNotification.tsx # A new component for displaying toast notifications.
src/components/common/ToastContainer.tsx # A new component for managing and displaying toast notifications.
src/context/NotificationContext.tsx # A new context for managing and displaying toast notifications.
```

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Ensure that all new components are created with proper accessibility attributes to avoid breaking Playwright tests.
// CRITICAL: Ensure that all new components are created with proper mobile-first styles to avoid breaking mobile responsiveness tests.
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Implementation Tasks (ordered by dependencies)

```yaml
Task 1: Install missing `date-fns` dependency
  - RUN: npm install date-fns

Task 2: Create `.env.example` file
  - CREATE: .env.example
  - CONTENT: Copy the contents of `.env` and replace all sensitive information with placeholder values.

Task 3: Implement robust error handling in qBittorrent service
  - MODIFY: src/app/api/downloads/stream/route.ts
  - IMPLEMENT: Add a connection test function, retry logic with exponential backoff, and more robust error handling with specific error types.

Task 4: Implement consistent API error handling
  - CREATE: src/lib/api/errors.ts
  - IMPLEMENT: A utility function for creating standardized error responses.
  - MODIFY: All API routes to use the new standardized error handling.

Task 5: Add input validation for service configuration settings
  - MODIFY: src/lib/services/SettingsService.ts
  - IMPLEMENT: Add more comprehensive input validation for service configuration settings, especially for URLs and credentials.

Task 6: Fix mobile navigation menu, touch targets, and accessibility
  - MODIFY: src/app/globals.css
  - IMPLEMENT: Ensure that all navigation cards have adequate touch targets.
  - MODIFY: src/app/page.tsx
  - IMPLEMENT: Add proper accessibility attributes to all navigation cards.
  - MODIFY: src/components/layout/Header.tsx
  - IMPLEMENT: Fix the mobile navigation button issue and add a type attribute to the button.
  - MODIFY: src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx
  - IMPLEMENT: Add a role to the navigation element and improve accessibility.

Task 7: Add loading states and Error Boundaries
  - CREATE: src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx
  - CREATE: src/components/common/ToastNotification.tsx
  - CREATE: src/components/common/ToastContainer.tsx
  - CREATE: src/context/NotificationContext.tsx
  - MODIFY: src/components/layout/Layout.tsx
  - IMPLEMENT: Wrap the children in an ErrorBoundary and include the NotificationProvider and ToastContainer.

Task 8: Standardize UI error messages
  - MODIFY: All components that display error messages to use the new toast notification system.
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Style (Immediate Feedback)

```bash
# Run after each file creation - fix before proceeding
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Expected: Zero errors. If errors exist, READ output and fix before proceeding.
```

### Level 2: Unit Tests (Component Validation)

```bash
# Test each component as it's created
npm test

# Expected: All tests pass. If failing, debug root cause and fix implementation.
```

### Level 3: Integration Testing (System Validation)

```bash
# Run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# Expected: All e2e tests pass. If failing, debug root cause and fix implementation.
```
